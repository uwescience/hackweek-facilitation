# Overview

This documentation provides information on methods for hosting and facilitating data science educational workshops, in particular short (1-2 week) interactive, participant-driven events. The approaches described here come out of experimentation with the [hackweek model](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/36/8872.short) designed within the [Moore/Sloan Data Science Environment](http://msdse.org/). Previous events include [astrohackweek](https://astrohackweek.org), [geohackweek](https://geohackweek.github.io), [neurohackademy](https://neurohackademy.org), [waterhackweek](https://waterhackweek.github.io), [oceanhackweek](https://oceanhackweek.github.io) and [Cryospheric Sciences with ICESat-2 hackweek](https://icesat-2hackweek.github.io).

In general, hackweeks aim to blend the best elements of summer schools and hackathons. There is no one right way to host and facilitate these events, and each version of our hack-events have experimented with a range of different approaches. This documentation is intended to serve as a general reference for event planners to choose from a range of tools that we have found work well. Specific implmentations will depend on the group size, the level to which particular communities have already adopted open source and reproducible methods, and the specific learning objectives of each event.
